# Pokerman Data Exploration

This is a final group project of 'Too Young Too Simple' for exploring Pokerman datasets. 

We try to answer two questions with Pokerman Data

+  Which variable (or variables) can define the type of a pokemon, if any? Also interpret your final model.
+ Predict whether a pokemon is legendary or not with justification.
